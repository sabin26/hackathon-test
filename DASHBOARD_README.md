# Make sure your video file is configured in config.yaml
python launch_dashboard.py --mode video --config config.yaml
```

### 4. Advanced Usage

For more control, use the full dashboard runner:

```bash
python run_dashboard.py --host localhost --port 8000 --config config.yaml
```

## Configuration

### Video Settings
Edit `config.yaml` to configure your video source:

```yaml
video:
    path: 'your_video.mp4'  # Path to your sports video
    supported_formats: ['.mp4', '.avi', '.mov', '.mkv']
```

The dashboard server can be configured when launching:

```bash
python run_dashboard.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080  # Make accessible from other devices
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI with WebSocket support for real-time communication
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with Bootstrap 5 and Plotly.js
- **Data Processing**: OpenCV, YOLO, and custom analytics pipeline
- **Communication**: WebSocket for low-latency real-time updates

### Data Flow
1. Video frames are processed by the AI analytics pipeline
2. Analytics data is streamed via WebSocket to connected dashboards
3. Frontend JavaScript receives data and updates visualizations in real-time
4. Charts and field view are updated smoothly without page refresh

### Performance
- **Real-Time Updates**: Sub-second latency for live data streaming
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized chart updates and DOM manipulation
- **Responsive Design**: Smooth performance on various screen sizes
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old data to prevent memory leaks

## Customization

### Adding New Visualizations
1. Add new chart containers to `templates/dashboard.html`
2. Implement chart logic in `static/dashboard.js`
3. Style with custom CSS in `static/dashboard.css`

### Modifying Team Colors
Edit the team color mapping in `static/dashboard.js`:

```javascript
getTeamClass(teamName) {
    if (teamName === 'team_A') return 'team-a';  // Red
    if (teamName === 'team_B') return 'team-b';  // Blue
    return 'unknown';  // Gray
}
```

### Custom Event Types
Add new event types in the CSS for proper styling:

```css
.event-type.your-event {
    background-color: #your-color;
    color: #text-color;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading
- Check if the server is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health`
- Verify no other service is using port 8000
- Check the console logs for error messages

### No Data Appearing
- Ensure video processing is running
- Check WebSocket connection status in browser developer tools
- Verify the video file exists and is readable

### Performance Issues
- Reduce video resolution in config.yaml
- Increase frame skip interval for faster processing
- Close other resource-intensive applications

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Fully supported (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Fully supported
- **Safari**: Supported with minor limitations
- **Edge**: Fully supported
